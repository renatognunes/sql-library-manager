This project uses technologies such as Node.js, NPM, SQL, Sequelize.js ORM, Express web framework and Pug template engine. I've built a Library Management System that allows the client to interact with the SQLite Database. The application uses all CRUD methods in SQL. The user can filter books by title, author, genre or year. The user can add, update and delete books from the database. Using specific URI's for each action. The applications also use Sequelize validations to make sure of the required inputs are filled.
